# Pine Time Admin Dashboard - Subdomain Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the process of deploying the Pine Time Admin Dashboard to a dedicated subdomain (`admin.pinetimeapp.com`) instead of a subdirectory (`pinetimeapp.com/admin`). This approach provides several benefits:

- Eliminates complex routing issues associated with subdirectory deployments
- Provides a clean separation between the main application and admin dashboard
- Simplifies routing configuration in React Router
- Improves security by isolating admin functionality

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with access to Amplify and Route 53
- Domain registered in Route 53 or with access to DNS settings
- GitHub repository with Pine Time Admin code

## Step 1: DNS Configuration

### In AWS Route 53 (or your DNS provider):

1. Navigate to your hosted zone for `pinetimeapp.com`
2. Create a new CNAME record:
   - **Name**: `admin`
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Value**: The Amplify domain (will be provided after Amplify setup)
   - **TTL**: 300 seconds

## Step 2: Create a New AWS Amplify App

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to AWS Amplify
3. Click "New app" â†’ "Host web app"
4. Choose GitHub as your repository source
5. Select your repository and branch
6. Configure build settings:
   ```yaml
   # Use the amplify.yml from the pine-time-admin directory
   baseDirectory: dist
   ```
7. Deploy the application

## Step 3: Configure Custom Domain in Amplify

1. After deployment, go to "Domain management" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add domain"
3. Enter `pinetimeapp.com` as your domain
4. Add a subdomain prefix: `admin`
5. Follow the verification steps
6. Once verified, update your CNAME record with the provided Amplify domain if needed

## Step 4: Authentication Configuration

### Cross-Domain Authentication

Since the admin dashboard will now be on a different domain, you need to handle authentication:

1. **Token Sharing**:
   ```javascript
   // When logging in from main application
   localStorage.setItem('admin_token', token);
   
   // In the admin app
   const token = localStorage.getItem('admin_token') || localStorage.getItem('access_token');
   ```

2. **API Configuration**:
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured on the backend to allow requests from:
     - `https://pinetimeapp.com` 
     - `https://admin.pinetimeapp.com`
   - Update the API configuration to use absolute URLs for cross-domain requests

## Step 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**:
   - Check backend CORS configuration in FastAPI
   - Ensure all origins are properly whitelisted
   - Update `app/main.py` with the new subdomain

2. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify token sharing mechanism
   - Check browser console for token-related errors
   - Test local storage access across domains

3. **Routing Issues**:
   - Confirm all routes use leading slashes (`/dashboard`, `/users`, etc.)
   - Verify that basename is empty string for root domain routing

## Step 6: Maintenance

### Updating the Admin Dashboard

When making updates to the admin dashboard:

1. Make code changes
2. Commit and push to your repository
3. Amplify will automatically build and deploy the changes

### Monitoring

Monitor the admin dashboard for:

1. Performance metrics in AWS CloudWatch
2. Error rates in AWS CloudWatch
3. API integration issues

## Next Steps

After deploying to the subdomain:

1. Update main application links to point to the new subdomain
2. Verify all functionality works as expected
3. Consider implementing shared authentication with secure cookies if needed
